      <h2>Luigi’s Bookshop FAQ and Info</h2>

      <h3>About Luigi’s Legal Fund Bookshop</h3>

      <h4>What is Luigi’s Legal Fund Bookshop?</h4>
      <p>Luigi’s Legal Fund Bookshop is an affiliate bookstore operated through Bookshop.org. Each purchase made via this shop generates a 10% commission that is fully directed to support Luigi’s legal defense fund.</p>

      <h4>Why does it exist?</h4>
      <p>It's a transparent, trustworthy way to financially support Luigi’s legal fund through book purchases, in addition to direct donations.</p>

      <h4>Why use Bookshop.org?</h4>
      <p>Bookshop.org supports independent bookstores rather than major online retailers, sustaining community-based book culture and promoting fairer income distribution.</p>

      <h3>Purchasing & Payment</h3>

      <h4>Can I purchase from the bookshop if I’m outside the United States?</h4>
      <p>Currently, purchases require a U.S.-based payment method and shipping address. Bookshop.org does not yet support international payments or shipping.</p>

      <h4>Why aren’t ebooks or audiobooks available?</h4>
      <p>Bookshop.org affiliate shops only offer physical books at this time. If this changes, we’ll update the shop information.</p>

      <h3>Finances & Transparency</h3>

      <h4>Why isn’t Luigi involved in the shop or its finances?</h4>
      <p>Federal regulations prohibit incarcerated individuals from receiving funds or conducting business. For example:</p>
      <blockquote>“Funds enclosed in inmate correspondence are to be rejected except as provided for in part 506 of this chapter.” — 28 C.F.R. § 540.23</blockquote>
      <p>Therefore, Luigi is not involved in any operations or funds management for the shop.</p>
      <p>If you think this is a silly rule, contact your representatives about it and help end the death penalty here: <a href="https://abolishdpandhelpluigimangione.github.io/">End the Death Penalty</a></p>

      <h4>How is the money split?</h4>
      <p>Each book purchase divides revenue among:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookshop.org for platform and fulfillment costs</li>
        <li>Independent bookstores</li>
        <li>10% commission to Luigi’s legal fund</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Does Luigi pay taxes on this income?</h4>
      <p>The shop owner receives a Form 1099 and is personally responsible for any taxes. Luigi is responsible for determining any tax liabilities on the legal fund’s end. This is not tax advice.</p>

      <h4>Is this shop safe and legit?</h4>
      <p>All purchases are processed by Bookshop.org, a secure and reputable platform. Full transparency is maintained through published financial reports.</p>

      <h3>Contact & Support</h3>

      <h4>Privacy and Data Security</h4>
      <p>We don't collect supporter data. Purchases are handled securely by Bookshop.org.</p>

      <h4>Refunds and Customer Support</h4>
      <p>Contact Bookshop.org directly for order issues or refunds. For questions about the shop or fund, reach out at [insert contact email].</p>

      <h4>Stay Updated</h4>
      <p>This FAQ and reports are updated regularly. Check back for the latest info.</p>

      <h4>Disclaimers</h4>
      <p>We operate as an affiliate of Bookshop.org. All purchases are subject to their terms of service and policies.</p>
